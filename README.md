# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose

To visualize campaign outcomes based on launch date and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

Based on the Parent Category outcomes graph, Theater category was the most successful category as it had the most outcomes compared to the other categories.  
Some of the challenges faced was grouping the data in pivot table to draw the conclusion.

## Results

Looking at the Outcomes based on Launch month, we can see midyear campaigns are more successful than the end of the year and the category, Theater, has the most successful campaigns in US.
One of the limitations to the dataset includes lack of factors/reasons pertaining to the success or failure of a campaign. We need to consider if the data is skewed.

In order to further analyze the trends of successful campaigns, we can create the comparison with the other categories for the campaigns rather than only Theater category and also taking into account the duration/time frame for a successful campaign.  We can also see the trend of campaigns for other countries
